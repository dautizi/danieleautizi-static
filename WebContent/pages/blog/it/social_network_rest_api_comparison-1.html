<div class="entry-content">
    <p>After having spent one year in designing and developing a membership solution based on 
    <a href="http://www.gigya.com/product/registration-as-a-service/" title="Gigya RaaS">Gigya RaaS</a> 
    for the Canadian media giant <a href="http://www.bellmedia.ca/" title="Bell Media">Bell Media</a>, 
    I was curious to understand better the effort in consuming web api for main social networks, which have been collected 
    and abstracted from Gigya in my task. Bell company owns many media websites (dozens) which used a personal membership flow, 
    different per each site, with a final result composed of redundancy on frontend/backend side, slow maintenance process 
    and difficulties in sharing users between sites. For this reason, in according with customer, we realized a solution starting 
    by the idea to have only a single membership site, pointed from all the others but still able to guarantee custom 
    functionalities where required.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let's imagine for example a site where editors allow people to do the login by twitter 
    and facebook, then another site of the same company where editors prefer linkedin rather than google+ and so on, well this 
    scenario means to develop an out-and-out service to configure and consume backend web api for all required social networks, 
    including all interaction flows as registration, authentication, reset password et cetera et cetera. That is what Gigya does 
    and what I was curious to estimate in terms of time and complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
    Well done Gigya but now it's my turn. To "play" with that I defined 4 simple rules:
    </p>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>only backend Rest API</li>
            <li>get user info and the main feature for the specific social</li>
            <li>3 hours as max developing time for a first draft</li>
            <li>re-use unofficial libraries if exceed 3 hours</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <p>Following the list of Rest API I tested:</p>
	<ul class="social">
        <li><a class="spotify" href="#spotify"></a></li>
        <li><a class="instagram" href="#instagram"></a></li>
        <li><a class="linkedin" href="#linkedin"></a></li>
        <li><a class="google-plus" href="#google-plus"></a></li>
    </ul>

    <div id="spotify">
        <h2>Spotify</h2>
        <p class="drop-cap">
        I start by saying <em>Spotify</em> and <em>Instagram</em> share the top for different aspects and this means I found Spotify Rest API 
        so simple, smart and rich of details. In 3 hours I was able to get back user info and build the playlist list 
        including an iframe player per each playlist.

            We are talking about REST Api designed with OAuth 2.0 as authentication model and json as response format. 
            My personal website <em>www.danieleautizi.com</em> is developed in java, for this reason I used the example 
            project <a href="https://github.com/thelinmichael/spotify-web-api-java" title="Spotify Rest API Java">Spotify Rest API Java</a> 
            to start with.

    <div id="instagram">
        <h2>Instagram</h2>
        <p class="drop-cap">
        My favourite social network ever? <em>Instagram</em>! The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/" title="Instagram Rest API Documentation">documentation</a> 
        is super complete even if the samples are not as much as I expected, they follow the standard RestFul design and in adding the OAuth 2.0 as authentication 
        protocol. I was spending more than 2 hours to handle the authentication in a fancy way, for this reason I used the library 
        <a title="Sachin Handiekar sachin-handiekar jInstagram" href="https://github.com/sachin-handiekar/jInstagram" target="_blank">jInstagram</a>. 
        Getting user info and last 20 pictures have been posted for the specific account was just a child's play.

            Instagram REST Api can support json and jsonp as response format. I noticed high performance in response even with quite complex requests.

        <p class="drop-cap">
        Lately <em>Linkedin</em> represents the most efficient "tool" in recruitment of qualified resources. Actually I 
        think it comes from a great idea and it works well for the original purpose. I spent only 1 hour to realize I would not get more info
        than I had already got. The free license key does not allow to have previous positions and technologies tags that represent an 
        important feature in my opinion.

            Again simple REST Api designed with OAuth 2.0 as authentication model but they provide xml in adding to json and jsonp as response format.

    <div id="google-plus">
        <h2>Google+</h2>
        <p class="drop-cap">
        This Google's "baby" is probably the less used product its team has ever created but I was too much curious to test it. 
        Consuming <em>Google+</em> Rest API is not distant from consuming any other google service, good documentation, smart and clean sample code. 
        I had some problems in setting the callback for local environment, even if it was well configured on google application panel. 
        Anyway 3 hours are enough if I don't consider what I wasted to solve the callback bug.

            I think sometimes having many different solutions to the same problem, adds complexity and doubts. However no doubt on google code quality.
