    <h5>Locker room as life style</h5>
    <p>Implementing the "locker room" concept inside a work place can 
       improve the team spirit and make the work place friendlier but not less competitive.
       <br>
       This is not only a thought of mine but what I realized by work experiences.
       <br><br>
       The perfect team should have few and simple rules and everybody has to follow them until the end.
       <br>
       Which rules?! The following ones:
       <br><br>
       nobody gets left
       <br>
       win and lose together
       <br>
       problems must be solved inside
       <br>
       NO SWEAT NO GLORY
       <br><br>
       I am convinced it is possible to apply this concept everywhere, without caring how the location is made of, 
       soil, sand, cement, water or in jungle, office, bar, just apply it and swim, run, jump, kick, work and explore.
       <br>
