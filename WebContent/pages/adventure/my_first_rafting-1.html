    <h5>RAFTING EXPERIENCE</h5>
    <p>I was waiting for something like this for many years and finally I got it! 
        <br>
        The Marmore falls are located in Umbria, just one hour drive from Rome, so, why not?! 
        <br><br>
        Marta and I arrived at the morning, ready to jump into the raft but the pleasantly rude guide, called Umberto, explained the basic rules in about 40 minutes.
        <br>
        That's the only boring part of the entire experience but necessary in my opinion. The guide, in fact, talks strong to bring out people fears and warn about the opportunity to break the experience only before get into the raft.
        <br>
        Well, once inside the big raft shared with Marta and other 4 people plus Umberto, everything started to be so exciting, 40 minutes of pure adrenaline!
        <br><br>
        The final plunge into Nera river was just the cherry on top.
